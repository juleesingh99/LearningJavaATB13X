/================================================ API Fundamentals ====================================================/

Question - 01: Research about How API Works
Answer:
An API (Application Programming Interface) works as a messenger between my application and Server.
Basically API is like a bridge that lets different software systems talk to each other and exchange data.

🍔 Think of an API like a Waiter in a Restaurant:
- You (the customer) want food 🍕
- The kitchen (server) makes the food
- But you don’t go to the kitchen yourself, right?
- You tell the waiter (API) what you want by ordering from the menu

Question - 02: what happen when you type google.com in browser and how you see the google page and
               every time you time google.com in the browser then always same process happen?
Answer:
Note: Client here is Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc).

🔤 You Type google.com in the Browser
- The browser doesn’t understand just "google.com".
- It automatically adds https:// in front to form a URL → https://google.com

🌍 Browser Needs to Know Where to Go
- google.com is just a name.
- The browser needs the actual IP address of Google’s server to connect.

📞 DNS Lookup Happens (Like a Phonebook)
- The browser asks the DNS (Domain Name System) to translate google.com to an IP address, like 142.250.192.142

🔌 Connect to Google Server
- With the IP address, the browser sends a request to Google’s server over the internet.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) + SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security) Connection:
    When you combine TCP with SSL:
        TCP sets up the basic communication channel.
        SSL runs on top of TCP to encrypt the data.

📄 Fetch the Web Page (HTML Resource)
- The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server:

        “Hey Google, give me your homepage.”

📬 Server Responds with HTML
- The Google server sends back the HTML file for the homepage.

🎨 Browser Beautifies It
- The browser reads the HTML, loads images, CSS, and scripts.
- It renders the page nicely — and you see the Google Search Page.

🔁 Does This Happen Every Time You Type google.com?
Not completely!
Some parts are skipped using caching:
- DNS result
- TCP/SSL connection
- HTML/CSS/JS/images

So:
- If you've recently visited google.com, your browser might skip DNS and use the cached IP
- It might reuse connections or load some resources from cache

But:
- If you clear cache, restart device, or it’s your first visit, the full process happens again

Question - 03: How many Protocols are there for API/Network.
Answer:
There are dozens of protocols, but the most commonly used for APIs are:
1. HTTP/HTTPS (REST):
A request-response protocol used by REST APIs to transfer data over the web, usually using JSON.

2. WebSocket:
A protocol that allows real-time, two-way communication between client and server over a single connection.

3. gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):
A high-performance, binary-based RPC protocol by Google for fast communication between services.

4. SOAP:
An XML-based protocol for structured messaging in enterprise-level web services.

5. GraphQL:
A query language and runtime that lets clients request exactly the data they need from an API.

6. MQTT:
A lightweight publish-subscribe protocol designed for low-bandwidth, IoT and sensor-based communication.

Question - 04: what is the full form of API.
Answer: 📲➡️🌐 API stands for Application Programming Interface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question - 05: Full form of URL.
Answer: 🌐🔗 URL stand for Uniform Resource Locator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question - 06: what is the max length of the URL?
Answer:
✅ Maximum Length of a URL:
- There is no official limit in the URL standard (RFC 3986), but browsers and servers impose practical limits.

🔢 Common Browser Limits:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Browser	      |    Max URL Length                                                         |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet Explorer	      |   2,083 characters (with a 2,048-character limit for the actual URL path) |
Chrome	                  |   ~32,000 characters                                                      |
Firefox	                  |   ~65,000 characters                                                      |
Safari	                  |   ~80,000 characters                                                      |
Edge	                  |   ~2,048–8,000 characters                                                 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🛠️ Server-Side Limits (May Vary):
- Apache: Default limit is 8,192 bytes (8 KB)
- Nginx: Default limit is 4,096 bytes (4 KB)
These limits can often be configured.

Even though modern browsers support long URLs, it’s a good practice to keep URLs under 2,000 characters.

Question - 07: How or when the IP address update of our mobile?
Answer:
📱 What is an IP Address?
- An IP address is like your phone’s home address on the internet.
- It helps websites and apps know where to send data, like messages, videos, or search results.

🔄 When Does Your Mobile’s IP Address Change?
- Your mobile phone can get a new IP address in the following situations:
1. When You Switch Networks
    If you move from Wi-Fi to mobile data, or connect to a different Wi-Fi, your IP will change.
        🌐 Wi-Fi → gets IP from your home router
        📶 Mobile Data → gets IP from your mobile company (Jio, Airtel, etc.)

2. When You Reconnect to the Same Network
- If you turn off and on Wi-Fi or airplane mode, your device might get a new IP from the router or mobile tower.

3. Restarting the Phone
- Restarting may lead to a fresh connection, giving a different IP from the network provider.

4. After a Certain Time (Dynamic IP)
- Most ISPs (internet providers) use dynamic IPs, which change automatically after a few hours or days.

📌 Summary: Your mobile's IP address changes when you switch networks, reconnect,
or after some time automatically — because most networks give temporary (dynamic) IPs.
